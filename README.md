# trackyouritems - WORK IN PROGRESS
- *cant call steam api from webpage due to valve things with CORS / had to build small web server to handle api requests 
- Track your CS:GO items in one simple location and monitor their market price. Select items from your inventory you'd like to monitor and they will stay in your dashboard for quick access.
# current state 
- currently hardcoded with my steam 64 bit id - will allow client to change it later
- find market price of associated items and display in second tab
