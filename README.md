# trackyouritems
Track your CS:GO items in one simple location and monitor their market price. Select items from your inventory you'd like to monitor and they will stay in your dashboard for quick access.
# current state 
- ignore data.json made for self testing
- GET request to localhost:4000/trackyouritems will return JSON of inventory 
- currently hardcoded with my steam 64 bit id - will allow client to change it later
- in server console it will show you string version of listed names of your CSGO inventory
- need to get it onto index.html to display to client
