# trackyouritems - WORK IN PROGRESS
- cant call steam api from webpage due to valve things with CORS / had to build small web server to handle api requests 
- Track your CS:GO items in one simple location and monitor their market price. Select items from your inventory you'd like to monitor and they will stay in your dashboard for quick access. Some features yet to be implemented.
# todo 
- currently hardcoded with my steam 64 bit id - will allow client to change it later
- add images of item
- be able to 'star' items - put on dashboard for easy monitoring of selected items
- add total sum of inventory worth
- sort table by certain filters (hight -> low etc)
- (long term) see how to periodically send request for price and notify the user with a desktop notifcation (via chrome) when it reaches a certain price
