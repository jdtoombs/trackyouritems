# trackyouritems - WORK IN PROGRESS
- cant call steam api from webpage due to valve things with CORS / had to build small web server to handle api requests 
- Track your CS:GO items in one simple location and monitor their market price. Select items from your inventory you'd like to monitor and they will stay in your dashboard for quick access. Some features yet to be implemented.
# todo 
- better UI
- be able to 'star' items - put on dashboard for easy monitoring of selected items
- sort table by certain filters (hight -> low etc)
- (long term) see how to periodically send request for price and notify the user with a desktop notifcation (via chrome) when it reaches a certain price
