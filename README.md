# trackyouritems - WORK IN PROGRESS
Track your CS:GO items in one simple location and monitor their market price. Select items from your inventory you'd like to monitor and they will stay in your dashboard for quick access.
# current state 
# IGNORE THE SERVER IT IS USELESS RN TOOK A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN I ORIGINALLY PLANNED
- get request is redundant rn since the get request to local server is a get request to steam... leaving for now
- currently hardcoded with my steam 64 bit id - will allow client to change it later
- find market price of associated items and display in second tab
